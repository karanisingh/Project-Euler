# Project-Euler
Repository that holds my personal solutions to the problems on projecteuler.net.

### Project Status
This is something that I do every now and then when I get bored. I did many of these on an online compiler, so I am transferring them currently.

### Contributing
This is not really something you can contribute to :/

### Usage
To see the solution to a specific problem, you must simply call the correct function in the SolutionRunner.cpp file.
