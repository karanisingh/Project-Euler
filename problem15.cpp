//problem15.cpp: this file contains the function to the solution for problem 15

/*
* Problem 15: Lattice Paths
* 
* Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
* 
* How many such routes are ther through a 20x20 grid?
* 
* Solution: 137846528820
* Time: 41 sec
*/

 
/*
* Much simpler to use mathematics to determine a solution.
* my original thinking was to find the number of combinations of "downs" and "rights" where there have to be 20 downs and 20 rights.
* this can be easily solved using combinations: 40! / 20! * 20! = 137846528820
*/

/*
* Strategy: recursively calculate each path by calculating every path's potential paths and continuing
